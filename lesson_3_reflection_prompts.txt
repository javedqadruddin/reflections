git remote command lets you create remotes for your local git repository
	remotes are remote locations that you can push and pull commits to /from
	git remote    by itself will show you what remotes you already have on this repo
	git remote add [name] [url]
		-standard name for first remote is 'origin'
	git remote -v gives you more information the remotes you have inthis repo (verbose)
	git push [remote name] [local branch name] pushes that branch to the remote
		ex. git push origin master sends the master branch to origin

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You'd definitely use it when you're collaborating with other people.
  You might also want to use it to store your code in a place where it'll be safe even if something happens to your local computer


  git pull [name of remote] [name of branch on remote] pulls the latest commits from the remote onto your local repo into the currently checked-out branch


  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  	If you auto-pull, it might pull in changes that conflict with your own at  time when you are working on something
  	It's many of the same reasons you wouldn't want to auto commit
