git remote command lets you create remotes for your local git repository
	remotes are remote locations that you can push and pull commits to /from
	git remote    by itself will show you what remotes you already have on this repo
	git remote add [name] [url]
		-standard name for first remote is 'origin'
	git remote -v gives you more information the remotes you have inthis repo (verbose)
	git push [remote name] [local branch name] pushes that branch to the remote
		ex. git push origin master sends the master branch to origin

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You'd definitely use it when you're collaborating with other people.
  You might also want to use it to store your code in a place where it'll be safe even if something happens to your local computer
